# Welcome to Our API Documentation

## Getting Started

Welcome to our API documentation! This guide will help you get up and running with our powerful API in no time.

### Authentication

To use our API, you'll need to authenticate your requests. We use API keys for this purpose. You'll need to include your API key in your requests.

**Note:** Keep your API key secret! Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.

### Making Your First Request

You can make a simple GET request to retrieve user data. Ensure that your request is authenticated by including your API key.

### Available Endpoints

Here are some of the main endpoints you can use:

- `/users` - Manage user data
- `/products` - Access product information
- `/orders` - Handle order processing

For a complete list, check out our full API reference.

### Data Formats

Our API supports both JSON and XML formats. You can specify your preferred format using the `Accept` header.

### Example JSON Response

When you make a request, you might receive a JSON response containing user data, such as an ID, name, and email.

### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, we implement rate limiting on our API. The current limits are:

- **Basic Plan**: 60 requests per minute
- **Pro Plan**: 1000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited requests

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Changelog

Keep track of our latest API updates:

- **2024-05-01**: Added support for bulk operations
- **2024-04-15**: Introduced new `/analytics` endpoint
- **2024-03-22**: Improved error messages for better debugging
